Now that I’m thinking about it, another classroom tool I’ve used a lot this year is [DropVox](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irradiatedsoftware.com%2Fdropvox%2F&ei=oyozVKrxEvCLsQS1uoCICQ&usg=AFQjCNENarLqy6aNKM2XjoyJilkAihA7VQ&sig2=A7gCIxnjmK1cvm-NOKLTDA&bvm=bv.76943099,d.cWc). It’s functionality isn’t a lot different from the Memos app that comes pre-installed on iPhones. But, DropVox automatically uploads anything you record to a folder in your DropBox for you to listen to on a better set of speakers later. It’s a really helpful little app if you grade students on prepared singing, sight-singing, and so on. I’ve been using Lore as a course management site this year (it’s kind of like Moodle, but a bit more social), and it allows me to leave comments with grades that I post. Having DropVox recordings in addition to whatever notes I might make in class really helps me give better feedback to my students. And Lore allows you to upload those files along with your students’s grades so that they can hear themselves, too.
